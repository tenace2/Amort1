Notes for version 13 and 14 August & Oct 2012, and pending version 15 Nov 2012
This version is NOT YET up on following url:
http://www.simdock.com/amort-test/dev-silver/amort/m.Amort.html

August Fixes
Fixed a small bug/feature on the payment schedule,
...but note the payment schedule list still will not add up very well because of rounding issues,
...also noted the small bug is not really fixed,
...

Upgraded the jQuery Mobile versions

Changed the interest pick list to a slider with three decimal place accuracy.

Changing to Michael Goodwin Icon...but his didn't initially work as the file size was way off,
...then were corrected.
Note my attempts to alter back to a slightly different version of the free icon from creative-commons was very rough and needed huge refinement to look a better.
After update of icons to Michael Goodwins, then needed to also update powerpoint documentation (version 5),
...and upload to Google Docs, then change link on page.

October Fixes
Also noticed again in Oct 2012 the jquery library needs to be at least 1.7, and that better yet should simply upgrade to jquery mobile 1.2 and jquery 1.8

Also, mentioned in documentation link about the png optomizer

Corrected comment about 0.125% vs 0.25%

Added feature to check if localStorage has anything in it :-)
...then use local storage, rather than re-initialize all the values.
...but also had to put a refresh feature on page1 initialize.



November 2012
Also, needed to add feature for settings for amount range.
Adding ability to set an amount range setting for the Min & Max loan amount,
...this makes it a bit easier to use the slider,
...but somewhat affects the following:
  - Extra Payment page: currently max is $1K...but on a $5million house $1K extra a month doesn't make sense
  - Affordable Payment page: currently max is $5K...but if looking at $1million + house, max $5K a month doesn't make much sense.
For loans less than $300K resonable defaults seems to be:
Extra Payment max: $1K 
Affordable Payment: $5K 

Note on Extra Payment:
Until there is a "should I refi" feature, the min value should probably default to zero,
...this is because the Pay Schedule extra listing will show an running balance
    Principle | Interest   | Balance
1 | $144.09 | $333.33 | $99,855.91
2 | $144.57 | $332.85 | $99,711.35
3 | $145.05 | $332.37 | $99,566.30
4 | $145.53 | $331.89 | $99,420.78
If you know principle still owed, can then add up interest remaining from there down,
and this remaining interest will be the 'break even' point for any refi on whats owed.

The regular payment schedule shows just payment schedule
Principle + Interest = Payment
1 : $144.09 + $333.33 = $477.42
2 : $144.57 + $332.85 = $477.42
3 : $145.05 + $332.37 = $477.42
4 : $145.53 + $331.89 = $477.42

An argument for making resetting the min extra payment at higher loans is:
...will have a more rational smoother slider...but not by much,
...so still created the 'LSextrapaymntmin' and set too zero,
...that way will be there later, if want it.


Here is the rational:
Low
$1K to $50K 
- defaults $25K...at 4% - 30 yr, mnthly payment: $119
- $1k - 1% - 30 yr, min mnthly paymet: $3 bucks
- $50K - 9% - 10 yr, max mnthly payment: $633
Extra Payment max: $1K 
Affordable Payment: min 0, max $5K 

Medium
$20K to $300K 
- defaults $100K...at 4% - 30 yr, mnthly payment: $477
- $20K  - 1% - 30 yr, min mnthly payment: $64
- $300K - 9% - 10 yr, max mnthly payment: $3800
Extra Payment max: $1K 
Affordable Payment: min 0, max $5K 

Moderate
$200K to $600K 
- defaults $300K...at 4% - 30 yr, mnthly payment: $1432
- $200K - 1% - 30 yr, min mnthly payment: $643
- $600K - 9% - 10 yr, max mnthly payment: $7600
Extra Payment max: $2K 
Affordable Payment: min 200, max $10K 

Upper
$500K to $1.5m
- defaults $1M...at 4% - 30 yr, mnthly payment: $4774
- $500K - 1% - 30 yr, min mnthly payment: $1608
- $1.5m - 9% - 10 yr, max mnthly payment: $19001
Extra Payment max: $5K
Affordable Payment: min $1k max $30K

High
$1m to $5m 
- defaults $2.5m...at 4% - 30 yr, mnthly payment: $11935
- $1m - 1% - 30 yr, min mnthly payment: $3216
- $5m - 9% - 10 yr, max mnthly payment: $63337
Extra Payment max: $12K
Affordable Payment: min $2K max $80K

To make the above defaults happen for the Extra Payment max slider (on page5), and the Affodable Payment max slider (on page7), had to:
A.)-Created new local storage defaults for affordable payments and extrapayment

B.)-Augmented the page5 live event 'pagebeforeshow' to refresh the slider extrapayment,
  //new default for Extra Payment amount, page5
  //localStorage.setItem('LSextrapaymntmax', 1000);
  //localStorage.setItem('LSextrapaymntmin', 0);
  
B.1) Augment page5 live event for slider min-max labels
   Also augmented slider with Min-Max amounts at end of slider, per following forum post:
   https://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-do-i-add-text-labels-below-slider
   
C.)-Augment page7 live event 'pageshow' to refresh the slider afforable payment,
    ...the page7 pageshow event was originally established to insure whatever was in localStorage.LSmonthlypayment was defaulted.
  //new defaults for affordable payment amounts page7 
  //localStorage.setItem('LSaffordablemnthpaymnt', 477);
  //localStorage.setItem('LSaffordablemnthpaymntmin', 0);
  //localStorage.setItem('LSaffordablemnthpaymntmax', 5000);

C.1) Augmented page7 live event for affordable payment slider min-max labels

C.2) Augmented page7 with new css 'mylistingclass' style to show affordable listing as courier text.


D.)-Created new page8 live event 'pagebeforehide' to store above local storage settings depending on bracket button.

E.)-Augmented the page1 live event 'pageshow' to augment amount slider with Min-Max amounts at end of slider.

F.)-Augment the page3 Payment chart with interest setting at left and right???...not doing

G.)-Issue with the label font: Fixed!
http://www.simdock.com/amort-test/dev-scratch/amort/scratchtesting-Slider-label-font-issue.html
fix was to do inline adjustment: text-shadow:none; color:black; font-weight:normal
 
H.)-Page 6 - ExtraPaymentSchedule.html
Changed font on the schedule to courier size 8 with a css style alteration in the head 

I.)-Slider data entry window size: customsliderinputsize.css
Had to open this up a little bit wider, 61px seems to be optomium.

Also, need to do a copywrite.
